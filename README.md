# Launch Mod 5 Week 2 Assessment

## Part 1: Recording a Lighting Talk (40 minutes) (8 Points)

Imagine that you have been asked to prepare a 5 minute lighting talk in preparation for an upcoming technical interview. 

The prompt is: 

"Prepare a 5 minute lighting talk on one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. Because you will be asked about the S in SOLID later in this interview, your presentation should be on O, L, I or D." 

You will be given 30 minutes to prepare your lighting talk and then placed into an individual breakout room and given 10 minutes to record the five-minute video of your talk.

## Part 2: Code Review & Questions (50 minutes)

### Code Review (8 Points)

For the next portion of your interview, you will be asked to review some code and give comments on what could be improved. 

Your interviewer leads with "On our team, we do a lot of code review, and it would be a key part of your role. So we want to see what type of suggestions you would give and how you go about giving suggestions."

For this Code Review you be evaluated using the following criteria:
* Do you include at least five thoughtful code review suggestions?
* Do your suggestions include both *what* you're suggestions and *why* you're suggesting that?
* Are at least two of your suggestions about refactoring?
* Do you include a correctly named refactoring pattern in one of your refactoring suggestions?
* Is your tone professional and kind?
